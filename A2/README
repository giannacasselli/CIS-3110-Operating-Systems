-> Before building the program, please ensure the current directory is workdir/A2
-> If the summary is two be written to the file 'tcassell_A2.out' please pass the argument '-l'
    --> for example './A2 -l' to write summary to the file
    --> or './A2' to write the summary to the screen
-> The program will prompt you to select a menu option
    --> 1 for new spellcheck, 2 for exit
    --> If you are in an active spellcheck and wish to return to the main menu, enter 0
-> Once in a new spellcheck, you will be prompted to enter the dictionary file followed by the text file, separated by the enter key
    --> for example 'dictionary.txt' <enter> 'test.txt' <enter>
-> The spellcheck summary will be written to file or screen upon exiting

-> This program only functions with ASCII characters, i.e. if other UNICODE symbols are given, the program will not work correctly
    --> Best example is with apostrophes: this program cannot parse properly if anything but the standard ASCII apostrophe is given

-> There is one MEMORY LEAK; 200 bytes
    --> it is from a structure pointer called FileName, as this is the only struct that is 200 bytes in size
    --> this struct pointer has been freed, and everything initialized correctly (or so it seems)
    --> I cannot get this leak to go away, so just be aware that it will show up
