-> Before building the program, please ensure the current directory is workdir/A1
-> To pass arguments to the program ./A1 should be the first argument, followed by the desired files separated by spaces
        --> As an example, to calculate the histogram of wonderland.txt, the command would be as follows:
            './A1 wonderland.txt'
-> The program will tell you which file is in which child process
        --> e.g File 'wonderland.txt' is child process [PID]
-> If a file that does not exist in the directory is passed to the program, it will display an error message and terminate that child
        --> e.g. File Error: Could not open file for child process [PID]. Child Process will be terminated
-> If 'SIG' is passed to the program, the signal handler will display the according message
        --> e.g. Child [PID] terminated by signal 2: Interrupt
-> The histogram of the file is put into file[PID].hist
        --> e.g. For wonderland.txt, the histogram file contains the following:
                    a 9804
                    b 1746
                    c 3003
